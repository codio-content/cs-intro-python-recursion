## Recursion Exercise 4

**Problem**
Write a recursive function called `reverse_string` that takes a string as a parameter. Return the string in reverse order. **Hint**, the `slice` operator will be helpful when solving this problem.

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `reverse_string("cat")`, then the function would return `tac`
* If the function call is `reverse_string("house")`, then the function would return `esuoh`
