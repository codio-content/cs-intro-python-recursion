**Problem**
Write a recursive function called `recursive_sum` that takes an integer as a parameter. Return the sum of all integers between 0 and the number passed to `recursive_sum`. 

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `recursive_sum(5)`, then the function would return `15`
* If the function call is `recursive_sum(10)`, then the function would return `55`
